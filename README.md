# CooleyGo-NDA
CooleyGo's NDA form as of 2021-01

CooleyGo has two forms of US NDAs, one Mutual and the other One-Way.  We will treat them as a single repository and solution.  

These NDAs are also the base of the Agt-NDA-CmA solution, which is one of the most extensive demonstrations of Prose Objects.   But we will start fresh here, assuring that we are working with a current CooleyGo version and making the steps of code-ification clear.

1.  We do the Mutual NDA.  Put the Word document in /99/Original/.

2.  We modify the Word autonumbering to ease our conversion work.  We make the section numbers in the format 3.1.sec= .
