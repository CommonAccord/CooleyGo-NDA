CodersNote=We are substituting the UK version as the default, because it is more complete and is structured as a list.  Have replaced "clause" with "Section".

US.sec=Upon termination or expiration of this {_Agreement}, or upon written request of either {_Party}, each {_Party} will promptly return to the {_Disclosing_Party} or destroy all documents and other tangible materials representing the {_Disclosing_Party}’s {_Confidential_Information} and all copies (including electronic copies) thereof.

CodersNote="(including electronic copies)" is addition from the Singapore version.

LawyersNote=The last part of the list (3.sec, (c) in the rendered doc) is ill-formed.  It is numbered as a subsection, but only the first part of the continuation sentence is really a list item.  Beginning with "provided" the text modifies the whole list, not just the item (c).  Needs work.  ????

0.sec=Upon termination or expiration of this {_Agreement}, or upon written request of either {_Party}, each {_Party} will

1.sec=promptly return to the {_Disclosing_Party} or destroy all documents and other tangible materials (and copies) containing, reflecting, incorporating or based on the {_Disclosing_Party}’s {_Confidential_Information}
